# Maps for Speedrunning GTFO

This is a repository which aims to keep an updated list of all public maps. There may exist maps which are not public yet. 

## Contributing

If you wish to contribute either make a pull request to this repository or direct message `tgb03` on discord and I will add the maps you send. Also feel free to update maps you find to not be easily legible or old in any way.

If you need a map but don't know how to make them please either message `tgb03` on discord or make an issue on this repository and I will forward it to whoever can make the map.

### Naming conventions:

Map names should just be something that makes it easy to understand and that is the most important criteria. Because of this the ideas I put forth are not to always be respected and should only be used as guidelines.

# Credits

Beware that most of these maps have been published by different people. The full list this was taken from is in the credits.

Names are in alphabetical order as many maps have been made by different people adding on top of other people, and keeping track of everything is a nightmare. Thank all these people for the work they put in these maps.
